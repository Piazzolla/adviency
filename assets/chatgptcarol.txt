Verse 1:
In the neon-lit city streets,
Where the neon lights gleam,
We gather round to sing and eat,
A cyberpunk Christmas dream.

Chorus:
Deck the halls with wires and screens,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Tech and gadgets, all aglow,
Fa la la, la la la, la la la.

Verse 2:
The drones are flying through the air,
Delivering gifts with care,
While hackers try to steal the show,
It's a cyberpunk Christmas, don't you know.

Chorus:
Deck the halls with wires and screens,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Tech and gadgets, all aglow,
Fa la la, la la la, la la la.

Verse 3:
The virtual reality trees,
Are glowing with augmented reality,
We gather round to sing and cheer,
A cyberpunk Christmas, oh so dear.

Chorus:
Deck the halls with wires and screens,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Tech and gadgets, all aglow,
Fa la la, la la la, la la la.

Outro:
So raise a glass and join the fun,
It's a cyberpunk Christmas, everyone.
May your holiday be bright,
Merry Christmas, cyberpunk night!
